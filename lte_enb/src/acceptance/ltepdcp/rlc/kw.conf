#Things to remember:
# 1. This database file is based on variable concept. variables can be defined 
#    with "<equals>" keyword. 
#    for Example xx <equals> yy, will expand xx as yy.  
# 2. Output of make must be <prefix>_acc. if not please move the make output to 
#    <prefix>_acc
# 3. token as <compile> <run>, various gen specific token as <VER> are case
#    insensitive. Use lower case as far as possible.
# 4. left hand and right hand value for <equals> is case sensitive. 
# 5. variables inside <VARIABLES> and <VARIABLESEND> are global variales. These 
#    must appear at top of database. 
# 6. All other context specific variables are termed as local variables. 
# 7. Local variables can not be defined between two gens. For example it is 
#    wrong to define the local variable abc as below:
#    <compile>
#       cmp <equals> cmp_val
#       <00>
#            ...
#       <00_end>
#       abc <equals> bcd
#       <01>    
#            ..
#       <01_end>
#     However cmp defination in above example is correct to define variable for 
#     all compile options
# 
# 8. Expand logic is as follow:
#    First Global variables will be expanded. Form Down to up. 
#    It means down variable can make use of varible defined before this.
#    Local variable will be expanded at last. From Down to up
#    It Means global variable can not be used inside the Local Variables.  
#
# 9. tcm_repstr will replace the first argument value as second argument 
#    third and forth argument are in file and out file respectively.
#    tcm_repstr without any argument will display the detail Usage of this script.
#
# 10. Validation logic must exit with 0 in case of passed, and must exit with 1
#     in case of failure. The same logic is applied for compile as well as run 
#     validation logic 
# 
# 11. It is must to have "ver" as one of the gen
#
# 12. Please ensure your $path resolves tcm_repstr
#
# 13. This database is parsed by script parse_db. Please type parse_db without 
#     any argument to get uasage details of this parser script.
#
# 14. Please ensure to provide as mony comments as possible in your database
#     from maintainability prospective. Any line with first non whiteline char as
#     # will be treated as comment line.
