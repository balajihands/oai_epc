 * Interface to non-modem related functionality in Layer 1.
 * This interface allows control of functionality which is present in Layer 1,
 * but not logically belonging to radio operations.  Typically this interface
 * is used to gain access to peripherals which can only be accessed through
 * the FPGAs, and hence need Layer 1 software to proxy access.
