INSTALLATION
------------

These instructions assume you are installing over 3049 or later.
If not, please refer to the 3049 installation notes first.

- Backup nas-* config files from /mnt/config if you have made any changes you would
  like to be able to refer back to.  It is unlikely you will need to refer to
  these again and if you want to change anything in a nas-* config file then do
  so manually, do not copy the old config file back over the top as there have been
  a number of changes and new parameters added.

  A number of parameters have been moved from the config files into SNMP (e.g.
  Iu sigtran parameters) so you may need to configure these via SNMP after the
  upgrade.

- Remove old release tarballs using the following command:

    rm /mnt/Radisys-*.tar
    rm /mnt/Radisys-*.tar.gz
    
- Make a note of Binding ID format (TransportAssocBindingIdMSByteAligned) used 
  (last line in /mnt/config/nas-iu-configuration) as this file will be 
  overwritten as part of the upgrade process, and needs to be correct for the 
  specific gateway used.
    
- TFTP the file Radisys_${PRODUCT}_3.5_2008_v${SVNVERSION}_manual.tar to /mnt and unzip it:

    cd /mnt
    tftp -g -r Radisys_${PRODUCT}_3.5_2008_v${SVNVERSION}_manual.tar <tftp-server-ip>
    tar -xvf Radisys_${PRODUCT}_3.5_2008_v${SVNVERSION}_manual.tar
    sync

- To upgrade the kernel:
  Only execute the kernel upgrade if it has not been done before:
      
  To verify whether the kernel has already been upgraded exceute the following command:
          root:~> uname -a
  
  The output should have the same date and time as below:
  
          Linux blackfin 2.6.16-ipnetblackfin #1 Fri Sep 26 17:01:38 BST 2008 blackfin unknown
  The kernel needs upgrading if the output is not the same:
    
    /mnt/dbx/stop-apps  
    tftp -g -r uImage-v${SVNVERSION} <tftp-server-ip>
    mv uImage-v${SVNVERSION} /mnt/dbx/uImage
    cd /mnt/dbx
    chmod +x fap-flash
    ./fap-flash kernel uImage

- Now wait for the fap-flash utility to complete    

- IMPORTANT!  The unit MUST NOT be power cycled whilst the fap-flash utility is 
  running.  Doing so would corrupt the flash memory and render the unit
  unusable.


- Type 'sync' to ensure all data is written to flash.

- IMPORTANT!  Please ensure the file /mnt/dbx/dbxstart is present, has sensible
  looking contents (not empty) and is executable.  If dbxstart is missing, corrupt
  or empty then if you reboot you may lose IP connectivity to the unit.
  Improvements to help prevent this are available in the latest kernel build
  but flashing the unit with the new kernel requires a return-to-base.
  Check /etc/svnversion.txt for kernel version.  Kernel 3521 or later is preferred.

- Power cycle the unit.

- Upgrading a FAP that will be used with a TR069 server:

    - TODO: This information is out-of-date.  We now have new MIB and no longer have SNMP in hbs2-iu build.
    
    - Telnet to the FAP and execute the following commands:
    
        cd /mnt/config
        mv mib-params mib-params_old
    	
    - From a SNMP browser, perform the following actions:
    
      a) Configure the IP address of the configuration server (mib-objects /
         management / tr069) and commit to non-volatile (mib-objects /
         management). 

    - Verify that the mib-params file looks similar:
    
        root:/mnt/config> cat mib-params
        REM_SCAN_OK = 0
        LIVE_OSC_DAC = 1472
        1ST_CONFIGURATION_SERVER = 123.123.0.25
        2ND_CONFIGURATION_SERVER = 123.123.0.26
        3RD_CONFIGURATION_SERVER = 123.123.0.27
   
    - Reboot the FAP. The FAP will attempt to connect to the TR069 server and
      download the configuration, and restart using the plan downloaded. Any
      paramters not supplied in the plan, will be taken from the mib-params file,
      and any config not in the mib-params file, will be taken from the
      mib-params-defaults.  Downloaded plan has highest priority, followed by
      mib-params, followed by mib-params-defaults.
    
- Upgrading a FAP that will not be used with a TR069 server:

    - Before following this procedure make sure you have noted your FAP specific 
      configuration as this mechanism will delete the existing configuration.
      Below is a likely set of parameters that will need reconfiguring:

    - In a telnet session, execute the following commands:

        cd /mnt/config
        mv mib-params mib-params-backup
   	    sync
   	  
    - Now power cycle the FAP
    
    - Using an SNMP mib browser, configure the correct values for the FAP. As a
      minimum, set the values for the parameters listed above.  Write '1' to the
      commitNonVolatile parameter in order to store these parameters permanently.
