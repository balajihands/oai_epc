- Discuss dbxstart_alt with Anthony... he wrote one that would tftp new code but this doesn't fit with new flash structure and
  software update mechanisms.

- Test and document upgrade process.

- Medium range Rx FPGA.

- Discuss start-up with Anthony:
  - No longer do traceroute as eth0 is reliable.
  - May need to sequence configuration via SNMP with OAM activity e.g. by waiting for op state change; when does he do it?

- Will controlling machine always be 192.168.0.254?

- Make sure writing LIVE_OSC_DAC works from SNMP.

- Check how many REM scan result neighbour cells Anthony needs.

- Check REM results populate SNMP accessible attributes.

- Check radio cal... what do the new 3.5s have programmed?  Do we need to upgrade?  Do we trust the cal?

- Reinstate 3waysnmp.conf file in distro.

Release Notes

Software Upgrade

Software upgrades must always be performed according to the following procedure.  The old system
of simply unzipping a tarball no longer works.

  ftp <fap-ip>  # username=root, password=uClinux
    cd /tmp
    put Radisys_hbs2-rrc_3.5_2008_v<version>.tar
  
  telnet <fap-ip>
    /mnt/dbx/cli
    oam.update.apps /tmp Radisys_hbs2-rrc_3.5_2008_v<version>.tar
